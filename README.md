Basically this is a number guessing game and a random number is generated after you run the code and you are gonna guess the number between 1 to 100(both inclusive). there will be two levels easy and hard. easy level has 10 chances to guess a number and hard level contains 5 chances to guess the correct number. and as the user is trying to guess the number we will give a hint to them as number is too high if the user guesses a number higher than original number and lower when viceversa. and if the user guess the correct before the chances get finished he wins the game otherwise he loses the game.
